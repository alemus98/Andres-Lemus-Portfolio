# Andres-Lemus-Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio of my work meant to highlight the skills I've learned in coding. It was built from scratch and it has links to my deployed web applications. The portfolio will be updated as my skills improve over time. My goal with this portfolio is to impress any employers looking to hire for a position in the field. 

## Usage
To view my deployed live applications, simply click on the image/link.
